<!-- ## Micro Meta App -->

**Micro Meta App** is an open, easy to use, and powerful software platform that provides an intuitive **visual guide** to capture and manage Microscopy Metadata on the basis of the **[NBO-Q](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/NBOMicroscopyMetadataSpecs/tree/master/Model/stable%20version/v02-01)** revision of the **[OME data model](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.1.1/developers/model-overview.html).**

**Micro-Meta App** was developed as part of a **global community initiative** that led to multiple publications featured on a recent **Nature Methods FOCUS ISSUE** dedicated to **[Reporting and reproducibility in microscopy](https://www.nature.com/collections/djiciihhjh)**. 

> **Learn More** For more details on Micro-Meta App, consult our recent **[Nature Methods](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01315-z)** and **[BioRxiv.org](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.31.446382)** publications!.

# What is Micro-Meta App?

![Micro Meta App screenshots]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Micro-Meta App_composite screenshot.png){: .center-image }

With Micro-Meta App you can:

1) Use [**Manage Instrument**](https://micrometaapp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/ManageInstrument.html) to document the **_hardware specifications_** of **_transmitted light, epifluorescence, structured-light and TIRF light microscopes_** based on the **[4DN-BINA-OME](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroscopyMetadata4DNGuidelines/tree/master/Model/stable%20version/v02-01)** Microscopy Metadata model.

2) Use [**Manage Settings**](https://micrometaapp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/ManageSettings.html) to document the **acquisition settings** that were used to collect a _**specific image dataset**_. Here, the user extracts metadata available in the image header and in previously created Microscope.JSON files, enters missing information and produces a JSON file summarizing the conditions that were used for a specific acquisiton session.

## Availability

The latest stable *beta* release is available as follows:

### Application
* The latest version of the Javascript [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) desktop application can be downlowaded [here](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-Electron/releases/latest) 

### Source code
* Javascript [React](https://reactjs.org/) implementation is [available here](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-React)
* Javascript [Electron-wrapped](https://www.electronjs.org/) implementation is [available here](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-Electron)
* Prototype [OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/scientists/) plugin is [available here](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-Omero)

## Major changes

<!-- See the [changelog]() for more details. -->

* Updated data model including several new hardware components descrbed in the **Core and Basic extension** of the [**v2.00 of the 4DN-BINA-OME**](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/NBOMicroscopyMetadataSpecs/tree/master/Model/stable%20version/v02-00) Microscopy Metadata model.
* Manage Settings component of the application to import image metadata from file headers using Bio-Formats.
* Improved GUI usability
* Several bug fixes ([link](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-React/issues))

> **Important!** It is not recommended to mix different versions of Micro Meta App for working on Microcope or Settings files. 
If you started a project using in a previous version of the App please first **save your file with the latest version** and then proceed with collecting image acquisiton settings. 

> **Important!** If you started your project with an **alpha version of the app** please let us know and we will help you with the transition.

## Example datasets

> **AVAILABLE EXAMPLE FILES** A set of publicly available example JSON files that were generated using Micro-Meta App to document microscopy experiments from 16 different individual core facilities and videos to torials to get started are available:[here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5847477) from Zenodo.org.

> If you are a newby and you want to learn more about the importance of metadata and quality control to ensure full reproducibility, quality and scientific value in light microscopy, please take a look at our recently posted overview manuscript entitled **"A perspective on Microscopy Metadata: data provenance and quality control"**, which is available on ArXiv.org [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11370).

# Future directions!

Stay tuned for upcoming changes/improvements:

* Full implementatino of the Confocal/Advanced extension of the [**v2.01 of the 4DN-BINA-OME**](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroscopyMetadata4DNGuidelines/tree/master/Model/stable%20version/v02-01) Microscopy Metadata model, which will allow to document **_Confocal and other Super-Resolution Miscoroscppy experiments_**.
* More intuitive GUI
* Initial integration of the of the Calibration/Performance extension of the [**v2.01 of the 4DN-BINA-OME**](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroscopyMetadata4DNGuidelines/tree/master/Model/stable%20version/v02-01) Microscopy Metadata model, which will allow to document **_Intensity Calibration, Optical Calibratin and Mechanical Calibration_**.
* Automated Material and Methods writing through integration with MethodsJ2
* Facilitated import of vendor information and a better integration with the OMERO server.
Stay tuned!
